# Guess-My-Number---Small-JS-Project
This is a small project that I made for Section 7 of Jonas Schmedtmann's JS course 

(You may check the repo 'progress' at 27th November, 2023 where I have posted the context surrounding this project. I chart my coding/learning expeditions on that repo's ReadMe)

In section 7 of the course, Jonas began teaching DOM manipulation. He showed the final state of a small project that he'd build for teaching DOM.
Before seeing his code, I took it as an exercise to build the project by myself. I did so successfully and have created this repo for it. 

It is a very simple number-guessing game, where the player has to guess a randomly generated number from 1 to 20. The game prompts the player if their guess is smaller or larger than the 
number to be guessed. Upon each wrong guess, points are deducted. If the number is guessed successfully, the game is won and a persisting high score is calculated. If the points finish (become 0) 
the game is over. The player may restart the game at any time by pressing the 'Again!' button on the top left.
